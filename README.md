# deckr41/nvim

> Functional programming with *AI agents instead of functions* and *folders

> **:brain: Pure Agents** encapsulate domain-specific knowledge and

`deckr41/nvim` is a Neovim plugin that adds ðŸ¤– LLM capabilities into your
coding workflow. It allows per-project AI customization through ðŸ“‚ collocated
`.d41rc` files, effectively turning folders into **Pure Agents** - AI agents
with their own identity, mission, and context, similar to pure functions with
clear domains and boundaries.

At a higher level, your projects become **Higher-Order Agents**, orchestrating
and composing Pure Agents to build features across your entire codebase.

## Progress

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most is work in progress and subject to change. The plugin is functional but
> many advanced capabilities are still in progress.

### Implemented Features

- [x] **Custom Keyboard Modes**: Use `easy-does-it` for on-demand code
  suggestions or `r-for-rocket` for real-time as you type suggestions.
- [x] **Run Commands in NORMAL and VISUAL Modes**: Execute custom context aware
  AI prompts directly from your editor.
- [x] **Dynamic Backend and Model Switching**: Change AI backends and models at
  runtime.
- [x] **Reload Commands on `.d41rc` Changes**: Automatically update commands when
  your configuration changes.
- [x] **Recursive Command Loading**: Scan and load commands from `.d41rc` files
  up the directory tree.

### Work in Progress

- [ ] **Semantic Search:** Generate, store, and keep embeddings synced for
  project files.
- [ ] **Fine-Tuned Models:** UX for training models based on specific project
  files for more accurate suggestions.
- [ ] **Background Commands and LSP Integration:** Run commands in the
  background and expose entry points through LSP.
- [ ] **Tool Support:** Implement custom tools for enhanced AI capabilities.
- [ ] **Enhanced UI:** Support `select` parameters, add `input` prompts, allow
  split buffer instead of floating windows.

## Installation

### Minimal Configuration

To get started, you need to set either the `OPENAI_API_KEY` or
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. If both are set, Anthropic is used by
default.

**Example for `lazy.nvim`**:

```lua
{
  "deckr41/nvim",
  event = { "BufEnter" },
  opts = {
    -- Your configuration here or leave empty for defaults.
    -- See below all options.
  },
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim"
  },
}
```

### Modes

- **`easy-does-it`** - Suggestions on demand with `<S-Right>`:
  - Press once to trigger the [`finish-line`](.d41rc#L28) command.
  - Press twice quickly to trigger the [`finish-section`](.d41rc#L56) command.
- **`r-for-rocket`** - Real-time suggestions with 1000ms debounce in INSERT
  mode. 

Configure modes in the `modes` key of your setup.

### Full Configuration Options

Below is the default configuration with all available settings:

```lua
opts = {
  --
  -- Mode configuration
  --
  modes = {
    ["easy-does-it"] = {
      -- Command triggered by pressing `<S-Right>` once.
      command = "finish-line",

      -- Command triggered by pressing `2x<S-Right>` quickly.
      double_command = "finish-section",
    },
    ["r-for-rocket"] = {
      -- Command triggered when entering or writing in INSERT mode.
      command = "finish-section",

      -- Debounce timeout in milliseconds, relevant for `r-for-rocket` mode.
      timeout = 1000,
    },
  },
  active_mode = "easy-does-it",

  --
  -- Backend configurations
  --
  backends = {
    openai = {
      url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
      api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
      default_model = "gpt-4o-mini",
      available_models = {
        ["gpt-4o"] = { max_tokens = 4096 },
        ["gpt-4o-2024-08-06"] = { max_tokens = 16384 },
        ["gpt-4o-mini"] = { max_tokens = 16384 },
      },
      temperature = 0.2,
    },
    anthropic = {
      url = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages",
      api_key = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"),
      default_model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
      available_models = {
        ["claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"] = { max_tokens = 1024 },
      },
      temperature = 0.2,
    },
  },

  -- If not specified, the auto-detect backend is used.
  -- If both are active, Anthropic is used.
  active_backend = nil,

  -- If not specified, the backend's `default_model` is used.
  active_model = nil, 
}
```

### Setting Up API Keys

Add keys to your shell profile file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
```

## Usage

### Default Keybindings

**INSERT** mode:

- `<S-Right>`: Trigger suggestions.
  - Press `<S-Right>` once to trigger the `finish-line` command.
  - Press `<S-Right>` twice quickly to trigger the `finish-section` command.
- `<Tab>` or `<S-Right>`: Accept suggestion.
- `<Escape>` or `CursorMoved`: Dismiss suggestion.

**NORMAL** and **VISUAL** mode:

- `<leader>dc`: Open the command palette to run AI commands.
- `<leader>dp`: Open the control panel to switch backends and modes.

### Commands

- `:D41EjectDefaultCommands`: Ejects the default `.d41rc` file into your
  current working directory for customization.
- `:D41ControlPanel`: Opens the control panel to switch backends, models, and
  modes.
- `:D41RunCommand`: Opens the command palette to execute a command from your
  `.d41rc` configurations.

## Understanding `.d41rc`

`.d41rc` files configure AI behavior and commands per project. Multiple files
can coexist, allowing flexible customization.

- **Special Nodes**: There are two special `.d41rc` files:
  - **Plugin's Default Commands**: Provided by the plugin, located at
    `plugin_path/.d41rc`. This is the file ejected by
    `:D41EjectDefaultCommands` command.
  - **User-Specific Commands**: Located at `~/.config/deckr41/.d41rc`, allowing
    you to add your own commands.
- **Command Loading:** Commands from all `.d41rc` files are loaded and
  accessible from the command palette via `:D41RunCommand` or `<leader>dc`.
  Commands are not overwritten; they coexist, and you can choose which command
  to execute from their respective file.

### Structure and Commands

Each `.d41rc` is a JSON object containing commands:

```json
{
  "$schema": ".d41rc-schema.json",
  "commands": [
    {
      "id": "zen-one-shot",
      "system_prompt": [
        "You are a Zen master named Zero, the master of one-liners.",
        "You will respond similar to how a Zen master would, in koans, short and succinct riddles, analogies or metaphors.",
        "Now. Take a deep breath. Each word written unfolds the answer."
      ],
      "prompt": [
        "{{TEXT}}"
      ],
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "max_tokens": 100
    }
  ]
}
```

Refer to the schema definition [here](schemas/rc.json).

### Variable Interpolation

The `system_prompt` and `prompt` fields support dynamic variable interpolation,
allowing you to include contextual information in your prompts:

- **{{FILE_PATH}}:** Current file path.
- **{{FILE_SYNTAX}}:** Current file's language.
- **{{LINES_BEFORE_CURRENT}}:** Lines before the current line.
- **{{LINES_AFTER_CURRENT}}:** Lines after the current line.
- **{{TEXT_BEFORE_CURSOR}}:** Text before the cursor on the current line.
- **{{TEXT_AFTER_CURSOR}}:** Text after the cursor on the current line.
- **{{TEXT}}:** Selected text (if any), or the entire buffer if no selection.

## Development

### Code overview

The plugin's architecture is modular, with each component responsible for a
clear, isolated piece of domain.
