`deckr41/nvim` is a Neovim plugin that adds ðŸ¤– LLM capabilities directly into
your workflow, allowing per-project AI customization through ðŸ“‚ collocated
`.d41rc` files, turning folders into **Pure Agents**â€”AI agents with their own
identity, mission and context, akin to pure functions with clear domains and
boundaries.

At a higher level, your projects become **Higher-Order Agents**, orchestrating
and composing Pure Agents to build features across your entire codebase.

## Progress

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most is work in progress and subject to change. The repo serves as my own
> scratchpad while I iterate and reason about what I actually want.  
> The plugin is functional but many advanced capabilities are still in
> progress.

## Installation

### Minimal Configuration

To get started, you just need `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
environment variables set. If both are set, Anthropic is used.

**Example for `lazy.nvim`**:

```lua
{
  "deckr41/nvim",
  event = { "BufEnter" },
  opts = {
    -- Your configuration here or leave empty for defaults.
    -- See below all options.
  },
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
  },
}
```

### Modes

- **`easy-does-it`** - Suggestions on demand with `<S-Right>`:
    - Pressing once will run the [`finish-line`](.d41rc#L5) command
    - Twice will run [`finish-block`](.d41rc#L38)
- **`r-for-rocket`** - Real-time suggestions with 1000ms debounce in INSERT
  mode. 

See `modes` key in configuration for setup.

### Full Configuration Options

Below is the default configuration with all available settings:

```lua
opts = {
  --
  -- Mode configuration
  --
  modes = {
    ["easy-does-it"] = {
      -- Command triggered by pressing `<S-Right>` once.
      command = "finish-line",

      -- Command triggered by pressing `2x<S-Right>` quickly.
      double_command = "finish-block",
    },
    ["r-for-rocket"] = {
      -- Command triggered when entering or writing in INSERT mode
      command = "finish_block",

      -- Debounce timeout in milliseconds, relevant for `r-for-rocket` mode
      timeout = 1000,
    },
  },
  active_mode = "easy-does-it",

  --
  -- Backend configurations
  --
  backends = {
    openai = {
      url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
      api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
      default_model = "gpt-4o-mini",
      available_models = {
        ["gpt-4o"] = { max_tokens = 4096 },
        ["gpt-4o-2024-08-06"] = { max_tokens = 16384 },
        ["gpt-4o-mini"] = { max_tokens = 16384 },
      },
      temperature = 0.2,
    },
    anthropic = {
      url = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages",
      api_key = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"),
      default_model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
      available_models = {
        ["claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"] = { max_tokens = 1024 },
      },
      temperature = 0.2,
    },
  },

  -- If not specified, the auto-detect backed is used. 
  -- If both are active, Anthropic is used.
  active_backend = nil,

  -- If not specified, the backend's `default_model` is used.
  active_model = nil, 
}
```

### Setting Up API Keys

Add keys to your shell profile file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
```

## Usage

### Default Keybindings

**INSERT** mode:

- `<S-Right>`: Trigger suggestions.
  - Press `<S-Right>` once will trigger the `finish-line` command.
  - Press `<S-Right>` twice quickly will trigger the `finish-block` command.
- `<Tab>`, `<S-Right>`: Accept suggestion.
- `<Escape>`: Dismiss suggestion.

**VISUAL** mode: *(Work in Progress)*

**NORMAL** mode: *(Work in Progress)*

### Commands

- **`:D41Eject`**: Ejects the default `.d41rc` file into your current working
  directory for customization.

## Understanding `.d41rc`

`.d41rc` files configure AI behavior and commands per project. Multiple files
can coexist, allowing flexible customization.

- Commands are loaded from `.d41rc` files up the directory tree, stopping at
  the first file with `"root": true`. *(Work in Progress)*
- Commands merge top-down, so closer `.d41rc` files can override those above,
  with deep merging for selective changes, for example allowing the addition of
  certain context files to an existing command. *(Work in Progress)*

### Structure and Commands

Each `.d41rc` is a JSON object containing commands:

```json
{
  "$schema": ".d41rc-schema.json",
  "commands": [
    {
      "id": "zen-one-shot",
      "system_prompt": [
        "You are a Zen master named Zero, the master of one-liners.",
        "You will respond similar to how a Zen master would, in koans, short and succinct riddles, analogies or metaphors.",
        "Now. Take a deep breath. Each word written unfolds the answer."
      ],
      "prompt": [
        "{{FULL_TEXT}}"
      ],
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "max_tokens": 100
    }
  ]
}
```

Refer to the schema definition [here](.d41rc-schema.json).

### Variable Interpolation

The `system_prompt` and `prompt` fields support dynamic variable interpolation:

- **`{{FILE_PATH}}`**: Current file path.
- **`{{FILE_SYNTAX}}`**: Current file's language.
- **`{{FILE_CONTENT}}`**: Entire document.
- **`{{LINES_BEFORE_CURRENT}}`**: Code before the line.
- **`{{TEXT_BEFORE_CURSOR}}`**: Text before cursor.
- **`{{LINES_AFTER_CURRENT}}`**: Code after the line.

## Development

### Code overview

The plugin's architecture is modular, with each component responsible for a
clear, isolated piece of domain.
